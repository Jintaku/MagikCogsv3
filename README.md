# MagikCogsv3

Magik Cogs v3 are for Red-DiscordBot v3. Red-DiscordBot is a multipurpose bot for Discord developed by Twentysix26.
To submit an idea for a cog, DM me on discord. You can always find me at the official server for Red or you can find me on my own Support Server here: https://discord.gg/d7YGVbH

Sadly, making and maintaining these cogs costs time, but no money. They're all made in my free time when I'm not doing anything else. But if you have Patreon, and you like my cogs, would you kindly think about donating some spare change by following the following link: https://www.patreon.com/magikbot and I thank you. :)

<h2>Currently working v3 Cogs:</h2>

Where <b>[p]</b> is the prefix for your bot.

# Say:
Use the ``[p]say <text>`` command to make the bot say what you want.
  Example: !say I will say what you type here
  If you send a blank message such as ``[p]say`` you will get a DM from the bot saying the message was empty.

# Away
Tell the bot that you are away and when someone tags you with @ then the bot will reply with a message that you are away.
``[p]away`` will give an auto response to tags with a simple message you are away.
You can also add a message so the bot can say why you are away with ``[p]away <message>``
Example: ``[p]away I am sleeping. Do not Disturb.`` The bot will return the auto message with your comments.
  
# Distance Calculator:
>NOTE: You will need **gpxpy** as a Depencency. use ``pip3 install gpxpy`` in your console. 

Use the ``[p]distance <coords>`` command and the bot will calculate the distance between the two coordinates. You will also be provided with the reccomended cooldown time.
Example: ``[p]distance 51.301597 -0.598019 51.270664 -0.594132``
This cog can be used for calculating distances for Pokemon Go ++ users.

# Bot Stats:
Use the ``[p]botstats`` command and the bot will display a list of commands for you to use. This will display information under the bots username where you see the "Game Status". you can choose a custom message or use the stats of the bot such as ``help, # of servers, # of users`` Dont forget, when you make changes using ``[p]botstats message`` you must first disable the bot stats using ``[p]botstats toggle``. 
  
# Pingtime:
Use the ``[p]pingtime`` command and the bot will display the ping of the bot.
This cog can be used to see the bots response rate.
