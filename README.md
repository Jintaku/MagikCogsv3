The MagikCogsv3 Repo is public and anyone is welcome to yse these cogs with their version of Red-DiscordBot v3.

Currently working v3 Cogs:

Where [p] is the prefix for your bot.

#Say
Use the `[p]say <text>` command to make the bot say what you want.
Example: `[p]say I will say what you type here`
If you send a blank message such as `[p]say` you will get a DM from the bot advising you the message was empty.

#Away
Tell the bot that you are away and when someone tags you with @ then the bot will reply with a message that you are away. 
`[p]away` will give an autorespoce to tags with a simply message you are away. 
You can also add a message so the bot can say why you are away with `[p]away <message>`
Example `[p]away I am sleeping. Do not Disturb` The bot willl return the auto message with your comments.
