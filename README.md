<h1>MagikCogsv3</h1>
Red-DiscordBot v3 Cogs created for Magik Botv3.

The MagikCogsv3 Repo is public and anyone is welcome to use these cogs with their own version of Red-DiscordBot v3.

<h2>Currently working v3 Cogs:</h2>

Where [p] is the prefix for your bot.

<h2><b>Say:</b><br></h2>
Use the `[p]say <text>` command to make the bot say what you want.<br>
Example: `[p]say I will say what you type here`<br>
If you send a blank message such as `[p]say` you will get a DM from the bot saying the message was empty.

<h2><b>Away:</b><br></h2>
Tell the bot that you are away and when someone tags you with @ then the bot will reply with a message that you are away.<br> 
`[p]away` will give an auto response to tags with a simple message you are away. <br>
You can also add a message so the bot can say why you are away with `[p]away <message>`<br>
Example `[p]away I am sleeping. Do not Disturb` The bot will return the auto message with your comments. <p>
