<h1>MagikCogsv3</h1>
Red-DiscordBot v3 Cogs created for Magik Botv3.

The MagikCogsv3 Repo is public and anyone is welcome to use these cogs with their own version of Red-DiscordBot v3.

<h2>Currently working v3 Cogs:</h2>

Where <b>!</b> is the prefix for your bot.

<h3><b>Say:</b><br></h3>
Use the `!say <text>` command to make the bot say what you want.<br>
Example: `!say I will say what you type here`<br>
If you send a blank message such as `!say` you will get a DM from the bot saying the message was empty.

<h3><b>Away:</b><br></h3>
Tell the bot that you are away and when someone tags you with @ then the bot will reply with a message that you are away.<br> 
`!away` will give an auto response to tags with a simple message you are away. <br>
You can also add a message so the bot can say why you are away with `!away <message>`<br>
Example `!away I am sleeping. Do not Disturb` The bot will return the auto message with your comments. <p>
