<h1>MagikCogsv3</h1>
Red-DiscordBot v3 Cogs created for Magik Botv3.

The MagikCogsv3 Repo is public and anyone is welcome to use these cogs with their own version of Red-DiscordBot v3.

<h2>Currently working v3 Cogs:</h2>

Where <b>!</b> is the prefix for your bot.

<h3><b>Say:</b><br></h3>
Use the "<b>!say <text></b>" command to make the bot say what you want.<br>
  Example: <b>!say I will say what you type here</b><br>
  If you send a blank message such as "<b>!say</b>" you will get a DM from the bot saying the message was empty.

<h3><b>Away:</b><br></h3>
Tell the bot that you are away and when someone tags you with @ then the bot will reply with a message that you are away.<br> 
"<b>!away</b>" will give an auto response to tags with a simple message you are away. <br>
You can also add a message so the bot can say why you are away with "<b>!away <message></b>"<br>
Example: "<b>!away I am sleeping. Do not Disturb.</b>" The bot will return the auto message with your comments. <p>
  
<h3><b>Distance Calculator:</b><br></h3>
Use the "<b>!distance <coords></b>" command and the bot will calculate the distance between the two coordinates. You will also be provided with the reccomended cooldown time.<br>
Example: "<b>!distance 51.301597 -0.598019 51.270664 -0.594132</b>"<br>
This cog can be used for calculating distances for Pokemon Go ++ users. <p>
  
<h3><b>Pingtime:</b><br><br>
Use the "<b>!pingtime</b>" command and the bot will display the ping of the bot.<br>
This cog can be used to see the bots response rate.<p>
